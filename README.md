# WebDev1
This is my first official WebDev project. 
While the sole purpose of this project is to help me develop and eventually showcase my web development skills, it also doubles as a passion project.
I've always been interested in fashion design and fashion history, so I decided to have this project double as a visual encyclopedia for my favorite fashion pieces.
Even after completing the bare bones/technical goals for this project, it will continue to be a work in progress as I add new entries and improve my coding skills.
Even if you're not a fashion history buff, you may still find this website to be fun to look at--eccentric garments and costumes are my fave! Feel free to revisit this project to view my web development progress/process, as well as see the new garments that I decide to add to the project.
Enjoy!
